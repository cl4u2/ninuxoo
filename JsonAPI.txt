== Search Operations ==

Operation: exactquery 
Description: return the search results that match exactly (i.e. performing an
AND between the exact words) <querystring>
URL: /json.cgi?op=exactquery&q=<querystring>

Operation: orquery
Description: return the search results that match the single exact words in
<querystring>
URL: /json.cgi?op=orquery&q=<querystring>

Operation: likequery
Description: return search results by performing variations on the words in
<querystring>, limiting to no more than <word limit> words
URL: /json.cgi?op=likequery&q=<querystring>&words=<word limit>

Operation: query 
Description: return search results by applying in order the exactquery, orquery
and likequery operations, trying to retrieve at least <nresults> results
URL: /json.cgi?op=query&q=<querystring>&nresults=<nresults>
NOTES: nresults default is 200

Operation: whatsnew 
Description: return the resources that have been recently discovered, trying to
retrieve at least <nresults> results, but no more than <nresults>
URL: /json.cgi?op=whatsnew&nresults=<nresults>
NOTES: nresults default is 200

response description: textual description of the response

number of result labels: number of set of results found

search time: time, in seconds, needed to perform the search

results label: the search term or terms that yield to the following results
